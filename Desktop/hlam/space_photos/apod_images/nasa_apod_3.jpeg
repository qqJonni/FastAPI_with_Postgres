Before airplanes, the phenomenon, known to some as the heiligenschein or the Specter of the Brocken, was sometimes seen from mountaintops.  There, when conditions were right, one could look away from the Sun and see what appeared to be the shadow of a giant surrounded by a bright halo.  The giant turns out to be the observer, as in the modern version a silhouette of an airplane frequently occupies the glory's center.  This bright  glory was photographed two weeks ago over Michigan from an airplane on approach to O'Hare International Airport.  The cause of the glory is still being researched  and is relatively complex.  Surely, small droplets of water in some way reflect, refract, and diffract sunlight backwards towards the Sun.  The phenomenon has similar counterparts in other branches of science including astronomy, where looking out from the Earth  in the direction opposite the Sun yields a bright spot called the gegenschein.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1612/PlaneGlory_Larson_1584.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"An Airplane Glory","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1612/PlaneGlory_Larson_960.jpg"},{"date":"2005-03-23","explanation":"What is that wisp on the horizon?  Scientists think that the slight white apparition is actually a Martian dust devil that was caught swirling across Mars.  The above image was taken earlier this month by the robotic rover Spirit.

Fresh dust devil tracks have been seen on Mars before, but actually seeing one up close was a surprise.  The most similar phenomena to Martian dust devils on Earth are terrestrial dust devils, tornadoes and waterspouts.  The ultimate cause of Martian dust devils remains unknown, but might be related to rising air heated by sun-warmed rocks and soil.  Just the previous day, Spirit's power acquisition increased unexpectedly, possibly the result of a dust devil passing near or over the Spirit rover and effectively cleaning its solar panels.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/dustdevil_spirit_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Dust Devil Swirling on Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/dustdevil_spirit.jpg"},{"date":"1998-05-31","explanation":"Phobos is doomed. Mars, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic. These Martian moons may well be captured asteroids originating in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or perhaps from even more distant reaches of the Solar System. In this 1977 Viking orbiter image, the largest moon, Phobos, is seen to be a heavily cratered asteroid-like object. It is about 17 miles across and zips through the Martian sky completing an orbit in less than 8 hours. Phobos orbits so close to Mars, (about 3,600 miles above the surface compared to 250,000 miles for our Moon) that gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down. In 100 million years or so it should crash into the surface or be shattered by stress caused by the relentless tidal forces, the debris forming a ring around Mars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/phobos.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Phobos: Doomed Moon of Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/phobos.gif"},{"date":"2009-12-07","explanation":"This was home.

The video dramatically shows the actual rotation of the Earth, called diurnal motion, in a clear and moving way, as if the camera were floating free in space.  The telescopes featured in the video are the Very Large Telescopes (VLT) in Chile, a group of four of the largest optical telescopes deployed anywhere in the world.

The collision caused ripples in the lunar crust resulting in the three concentric circular features visible in this 1967 photograph made by NASA's Lunar Orbiter 4.

This false-color infrared image from the Galileo spacecraft's NIMS instrument shows a newly discovered crater on Europa as a light red ring feature near center surrounding a dark core. For scale, the dark core is about 29 kilometers in diameter. Only seven comparably large craters have now been identified on Europa's surface. Red colors in the image represent a relatively pure water ice composition while blue colors indicate that other minerals are present.

A surprising answer to this seemingly inconsequential question came out of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, USA in 2001, and indicated that the Standard Model of Particle Physics, adopted widely in physics, is incomplete. Specifically, the muon, a particle with similarities to a heavy electron, has had its relatively large wobble under scrutiny in a series of experiments known as g-2 (gee-minus-two). The Brookhaven result galvanized other experimental groups around the world to confirm it, and pressured theorists to better understand it.  Reporting in last week, the most sensitive muon wobble experiment yet, conducted at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Illinois and pictured here, agreed with the Brookhaven result. The unexpected wobble rate may indicate that an ever-present sea of  virtual particles includes types not currently known.

Before dawn on January 7 the two naked-eye planets will reach a close conjunction near the horizon, only 1/4 degree apart in predawn eastern skies. That apparent separation corresponds to about half the angular diameter of a Full Moon. Just off the wing of a high-flying aircraft in this snapshot from early morning January 5, Jupiter (left) and Mars (middle) are also lined-up with the well-balanced Zubenelgenubi (right), alpha star of the constellation Libra. Below are lights from central Europe near Prague, Czech Republic, planet Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1801/DSC07952JupMars_DHan.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Planets on the Wing","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1801/DSC07952JupMars_DHan1024.jpg"}]
